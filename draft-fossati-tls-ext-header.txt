                   Extension Header for TLS and DTLS
                  draft-fossati-tls-ext-header-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes a mechanism to add extension headers to TLS
   and DTLS.

   In the process, it changes the (D)TLS header in the following way:
   the length field is trimmed to 14 bits, the length's top bit is given
   the "extension header indicator" semantics, the other bit is reserved
   for future use.

1.  Introduction

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Length Redefined

   [RFC5246] requires the size of TLS record payloads to not exceed
   2^14, which means that the two top level bits in the length field of
   the TLS record header are unused.

   The proposal here is to shorten the length field to 14 bits and:

   o  Use the top bit (E) to signify the presence / absence of an
      extension header;

   o  Reserve the other bit (R) for future use.

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |E|R|          Length           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   In the reminder, the top bit is called the "extension header
   indicator".

3.  Reserved Bit Considerations

   The reserved bit MUST NOT be set by a sender.

4.  Extension Header

4.1.  Format

   If the extension header indicator is asserted, then an extension
   header is appended to the regular header with the following format:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+------------+------------
   |M|   Type      | Length ... | Value ... |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+------------+-----------+

   where:

   o  M has the same semantic as the extension header indicator in the
      regular header - i.e.: if it is asserted, another extension header
      follows this one;

   o  Type is a fixed length (7-bits) field that defines the way Value
      has to be interpreted;

   o  Length is the minimal amount of bytes needed to encode the length
      of a legit Value for this Type;

   o  Value is the extension itself.

4.2.  Negotiation

   An extension header is allowed only if it has been negotiated via a
   companion TLS extension.

   An endpoint MUST NOT send an extension header if it hasn't been
   successfully negotiated with the receiver.

   An endpoint that receives an unexpected extension header MUST abort
   the session.

   Extension headers MUST NOT be sent during the initial handshake
   phase.

4.3.  Backwards Compatibility

   A legacy endpoint that receives an extension header will interpret it
   as an invalid length field [RFC5246] and abort the session
   accordingly.

   Note that this is equivalent to the behaviour of an endpoint
   implementing this spec which receives a non-negotiated extension
   header.

4.4.  Use with Connection ID

   A plausible use of this mechanism is in relation with the CID
   extension defined in [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-connection-id].

   In such case, the companion extension header might be defined as
   follows:

   o  Type: 0x01

   o  Length: 1-byte unsigned int

   o  Value: the CID itself

   Note that, compared to all other possible ways to express presence/
   absence of a CID field within the constrains of the current header
   format (e.g., bumping the Version field, assigning new ContentType's,
   using an invalid length), an ad hoc xtension header provides a
   cleaner approach that can be used with any TLS version at a
   reasonable cost (2 bytes per record).

5.  Security Considerations

   o  TODO discuss on-path active attacker - trying to modify an
      existing extension header or insert a new one

6.  Privacy Considerations

   o  TODO discuss metadata insertion - privacy implications must be
      discussed on a per extension basis

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new IANA registry that, for each extension
   header, shall define:

   o  the Type codepoint;

   o  the Length size in bytes.
